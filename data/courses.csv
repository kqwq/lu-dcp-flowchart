Migration policy has long provoked controversy and has become even more contentious in the new era of homeland security since September 11, 2001. Immigration bills in Congress have been the subject of heated debates, particularly in recent years. However, to have a truly informed opinion on the subject, one must understand the history of immigration law in the United States, the statutory framework into which any new legislation must fit, and the legal process used to enforce U.S. immigration law. This course will examine federal immigration law and policy in a variety of its aspects--contemporary and historical, substantive and procedural, statutory and regulatory and constitutional--including the criteria for admission to the United States on a temporary or permanent basis, the grounds and process of deportation, the peculiar constitutional status of foreign nationals, the role of the courts in ensuring the legality of official action, and an introduction to refugee law.","3393","","Resident","2","","","","2022"
